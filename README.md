# cct-sandbox

Unstable application libraries for the HPE Cognitive Computing Toolkit (CCT). This package contains experimental 
library routines in the following domains:

  1. [Computer vision](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-sandbox/tree/master/src/main/scala/toolkit/computervision)
  2. [Dynamical systems](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-sandbox/tree/master/src/main/scala/toolkit/dynamicalsystems)
  3. [Filtering](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-sandbox/tree/master/src/main/scala/toolkit/filtering)
  4. [Solvers](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-sandbox/tree/master/src/main/scala/toolkit/solvers)
  5. [Statistics](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-sandbox/tree/master/src/main/scala/toolkit/statistics)

The routines in this library are either too experimental or too sparse to justify breaking out into
a top-level CCT library like [cct-nn](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-nn).

If you're new to CCT, start with the [tutorial](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-tutorial).
